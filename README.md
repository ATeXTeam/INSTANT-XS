# INSTANT-XS

This is a app "inspired" from ***Linux Terminal*** which is made for slow PCs which cant even open file explorer and people who dont have time
This thing opens apps instantly, for now this may suck but in future we will upgrade it and remove bugs (if any)

if you find a bug please inform us, we will surely fix it.

enjoy the app!
